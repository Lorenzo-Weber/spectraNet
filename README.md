# Spectra NET for Classifying Crops

This project is a simple experiment based on the paper proposed by Zeit AI, which focuses on predicting soybeans contents with a CNN regressor. 

## My Approach

My approach was basically the same as in the paper, with the following differences:
- Number of neurons in the dense layers
- Weights initialization
- Learning rate
- I did not apply data augmentation

## Results

The network performed really well, achieving, on average:
- **82% precision** 
- **84% recall**
